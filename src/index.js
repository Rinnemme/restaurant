    bit of everything our magnificent planet offers. We're like if the New York City food 
    scene was a single restaurant! <br><br>
    
    However, unlike certain chains whose extensive and diverse menu seems to suggest a 
    wide breadth of culinary expertise - but whose dishes feel appropriately devoid of 
    love and personality for an establishment bearing 'factory' in its name - our dishes 
    are made with love, and apart from a few staples, the menu of our locations varies 
    specifically because we only offer that with which we know our chefs are intimately 
    familiar and will delight in and excel at cooking.`

    required sustenance in order to perpetuate their meager existence, the meaning of 
    which has been contemplated with considerable vigor from the moment Ren√© Descartes 
    discovered thinking. However, it was only relatively recently in the history of this 
    particular galaxy's sentient life when we learned that this sustenance can be prepared 
    in a way that not only is effective at sustaining us, but which causes the gustatory 
    cells with which the human tongue is rife to send signals to our brain that result in 
    a release of chemicals we have collectively decided constitute something called pleasure. 
    <br><br>
    
    From here, two things happened: first, beautifully diverse methods of curating and 
    preparing foods were developed in all corners of our Earth; and second, through a 
    combination of imperialism and appropriation, cheap imitations of one culture's techniques 
    began cropping up within other cultures, diminishing their differentiable qualities and 
    consequently lowering the value that diversity in food preparation provides. Nomnivore 
    was established in 2023 to act as an antithesis to the latter, which is to say that our
    history is only beginning, but our mission is one most imperative to humanity's collective
    culinary integrity.`
